#Webscraping Tools

This repo contains the following scripts that perform various webscraping activities:


1. "carmax_scraper.ipynb"
    This file uses BeautifulSoup to scrape all CarMax dealership locations found on CarMax's website. I wrote this program while I was an RA working on a research project aiming to study the effect of month-end dealer incentives on borrower credit scores.
    
2. "ffiec_fips_scraper.ipynb"
    This file uses Selenium to automate the process of searching for a county code by typing in the address of the location. I wrote this for fun.

3. "factiva_master_program.ipynb"
   "factiva_procedural_commands.ipynb"
   "factiva_word_storage.ipynb"
   These files use Selenium to automate the process of searching for articles/newswires within a specific time range on Factiva and saving relevant text files. I wrote this as an RA for a project focusing on firm repurchase/buyback announcements and the impact it has on stock prices.
