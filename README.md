# Webscraping Tools

This repo contains various python scripts I wrote as an RA to automate data collection from public sources:

## 1. "carmax_scraper.ipynb"
    This file uses BeautifulSoup to scrape all CarMax dealership locations found on CarMax's website. 
        
    Information about CarMax's dealership locations could answer many interesting questions. 
    For instance, does the introduction of CarMax dealers induce other autolenders to extend credit more aggressively?               
    
## 2. "ffiec_fips_scraper.ipynb"
    This file uses Selenium to automate the process of searching for a county code by typing in the address of the location.

## 3. Factiva files
   These files use Selenium to automate the process of searching for articles/newswires within a specific time range on Factiva and saving relevant text files. 
   I wrote this as an RA for a project focusing on firm equity repurchase/buyback announcements and the impact it has on their stock prices.
